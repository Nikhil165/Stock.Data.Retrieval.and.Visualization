# Stock Data Retrieval and Visualization

The Stock Data Retrieval and Visualization project is a comprehensive Python program designed to fetch real-time stock data from the Finnhub API and provide visual representations of the data using the matplotlib library. This project aims to empower users with valuable insights into stock market trends and facilitate informed investment decisions. By combining powerful data analysis capabilities with an intuitive user interface, users can easily retrieve current and historical stock data, analyze the data points, and visualize the closing prices of stocks over time.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data Retrieval**: The program fetches current stock market data from the Finnhub API, including the current price, previous day's closing price, opening price, and more.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Users can retrieve historical stock data for the past 30 days, enabling the identification of long-term trends and patterns.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: JSON responses from the API are parsed, and relevant data points are extracted for further analysis, such as computing price changes and percentages.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: The program utilizes the matplotlib library to generate visually appealing and interactive graphs, such as line plots, to depict the closing prices of stocks over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that prompts users to enter stock symbols and presents the retrieved data in a clear and organized manner.

## Project Details
